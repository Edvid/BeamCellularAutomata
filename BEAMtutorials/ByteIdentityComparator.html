            <h1>Byte Identity Comparator</h1>
            <p>This circuit takes a byte as it's input and compares it with an internal byte, and returns HIGH if the bytes are equal to eachother.<br><br>
            The circuit is in two parts; a default identity comparator that returns HIGH only when all 8 incomming signals are HIGH (Identity Comparator n==0xFF or n==255), 
            and a row of some NOT gates to make any byte we wish to compare to. <br>
            The default Identity Comparator (n==255), consists of a tree of AND gates, so that all 8 inputs need to be HIGH in order to output a HIGH itself.<br><br>
            <img src="source/DefaultIdentityComparatorLayout.jpg" alt="The formal layout of the default Identity comparator" width="50%"> <br><br>
            The row of not gates are placed before the first row of AND gates, negating whichever we need. In the example below we do <i>NOT, FREE, FREE, NOT... FREE, NOT, NOT, FREE</i>, 
            so that it only returns true at (n==0b0110_1001) => (n==0x69) => (n==105).<br>
            <img src="source/DefaultIdentityComparatorLayout2.jpg" alt="The formal layout of the default Identity comparator, including NOT gates" width="50%"><br><br>
            But before we can build this is BEAM, we must first asks ourselves, "How far apart should the initial row of AND gates be placed?". 
            If we only want to use the 8 bit counter's output once, we can of course build the Default Identity comparator as densily as we can fit the AND gates together. 
            But in a much larger curcuit, where we would want to retain the 8 bit counter's output despite using it, we have to be a little more tactical with our builds.
            splitting a single beam of arrows in two perpendicular direction is simple (single diamond, or square for diagonal directions), and making one of the outgoinging signals be of 
            the same direction as the initial beam of arrows is also rather simple (turn the signal 90 degrees with a diamond or square, together with its opponent as to block one 
            outgoing beam). The issue arrises when we have two beams we want to split.<br>
            <img src="source/2BeamsWrong.jpg" alt="Wrong way of splitting two beams" width="50%"><br><br>
            We run into a collision, unless we include a bridge<br>
            <img src="source/2BeamsCorrect.jpg" alt="Right way of splitting two beams" width="50%"><br><br>
            We need <b>A LOT</b> of bridges when we need to cross 8 Beams and prevent any possible collision<br>

            Our bridges in <abbr title="Byte-wise Electric Arrow Machine">BEAM</abbr> are 10x10 cells big, and the final 8 beam bridge looks like this<br>

            We can now get back to designing the default Identity comparator. The AND gate's 8 initital input must be 10 cells apart each!<br> 
            That means we will be splitting the AND gate in two halves, like so:<br>
            <img src="source/AND10cells.png" alt="AND gate, but x and y are 10 columns apart" width="205px"><br><br>
            We combine all And gates to form our default Identity Comparator:<br>

            Add our NOT gates where we decided to do so, and squash it all together: <br>

            <iframe src="source/documents/8bitBridgeWithIdentityComparator" height="375" style="background-color: white;"></iframe><br><br>
            We use this NOT gate as its path exists where the path would otherwise have been, so we avoid having to move anything around. Just add these where we need them:<br>

            Beautiful! but there's one last fix we need to take care off.... Each of the Bridges offsets the signal by 1, which 
            is done with some internal diagonal beams. This means, that if we were to make an array of the 8 bit bridges, 
            we would have some bit beams set further back than others, while still maintaining the same progression downwards 
            (as some bit beams pass through far more bridges than others). This will make the beams out of sync, and they will reach their AND gates 
            more and more out of sync, the further down the array we are. <br>
            There's only one thing we can do; Send the beams forward again without making them lose downwards progression..
             <i>With diagonals</i>.<br>
