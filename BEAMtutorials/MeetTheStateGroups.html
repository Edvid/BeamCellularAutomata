                    The Vectors represent a force which it applies to the neighbour cell in that direction. <br>
                    E.g. Vector state 1 (which we also call the North Western Vector) will apply a North Western force to its North Western neighbour next generation. <br>
                    Similarly, Vector state 2 (which we also call the North Vector) will apply a North force to its North Neighbour next step. etc...<br>
                    <br>
                    As this is a cellular Automaton, we determine a cells state using its neighbourhood, 
                    rather than set the state of a neighbour given the center state. So we do the above-described in reserve.<br>
                    <img src="source/ArrowInfluenceDiagram.png" alt="Arrow Influence Diagram" height="90" width="90">
                    <br>
                    We essentially figure out, if the neighbours apply forces to the center cell.
                    E.g. if our north western neighbour is a south-east vector. (when we visit the other stategroups you'll see that it's not just Vectors that can apply these forces).<br>

                    Vectors may combine into new Vectors if multiple Vectors meet. 
                    The resultant forces are then calculated and the corresponding vector-state is found. 
                    The vectors are clamped to values of -1, 0, 1 on each axis to determine its direction and finally its (1 of 9 possible) states.
                    I call the axes the N-axis and E-axis to not confuse which direction on a XY coordinate system makes for increasing or decreasing values along that axis.
                    Because of the clamping of values, these axes can be considered a finite size, 
                    having a point on the axis either <i>Positive, Neutral, or Negative</i><br>
                    Therefore a cell whose south eastern neighbour has a north western Vector (+N, -E), 
                    and a southern neighbour with a northern Vector (+N, øE), 
                    will still result in a north western vector (+N + +N = +N, -E + øE = -E).<br>

                    The square has three possible states. <i>still, rising, and falling</i>. The last two states are 
                    activated forms of the square. When activated, it will both light up and A diagonal line will appear across it.
                    That diagonal line may either go from buttom-left to top-right (rising if read from left to right). or top-left
                    to buttom-right (falling, if read from left to right). 
                    The line ends in each of the two corners the square "will shoot arrows out of". 
                    and it is activated by having 1 and only one incoming vector on either of its four corners (diagonally adjecent neighbour-cells).<br>

                    The square's edges does not influence the state of it nor can it change cells next to its edges. 
                    <b><i>It is therefore a very efficient way of blocking arrow paths</i></b> which we will use extensively in later examples, 
                    along side the diamond with very similar properties.<br>

                    The diamond too has three possible states. <i>still, flat, erect</i>. The last two states are too activation states.
                    It too will light up and get either a horizontal (flat) or vertical (erect) line across. 
                    The lines too represent the directions in which it "will shoot arrows out". It too is activated when 1 and only 1
                    path is recieved from either of <i>its</i> four corners (the cell's neighbours that it shares an <i>edge</i> with).<br>

                    Well, I put my lies in quotation marks, so I hinted it wasn't the full story.
                    So here's the very most formal explaination you'll get: <br>
                    As for when I explained how we needed to think of the vectors applying forces to a center cell,
                    rather than a center cell "setting" the state of neighbouring cells, we need to apply that same logic to squares, diamonds, and beamers.<br>
                    Just like The North-Western Vector may apply a force to the center cell, if and only if that Vector is in the South-Eastern cell, and
                    The North Vectr may apply a force to the center cell, if and only that Vector is in the Southern cell. Then: 
                    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
                        <li>
                             The rising square may apply a force the center cell, if and only if it is either in the "North-Eastern" or "South-Western" cell.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The falling square may apply a force the center cell, if and only if it is either in the "North-Western" or "South-Eastern" cell.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The flat diamond may apply a force the center cell, if and only if it is either in the "Eastern" or "Western" cell.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The erect diamond may apply a force the center cell, if and only if it is either in the "Northern" or "Southern" cell.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The beamer shall always apply a force center cell.
