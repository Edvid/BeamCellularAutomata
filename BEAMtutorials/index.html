                Introduction:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The <abbr title="Cellular Byte-wise Electric Arrow Machine Automaton">BEAM CA</abbr> is a Cellular Automaton developed by <i>Me</i> in Early February 2020, 
                and a <a href="source/documents/Beam.rule">.rule file for Golly</a> in mid-February 2020. 
                I personally think it's the easiest cellular automaton to get your head around when it comes to building circuitry. 
                I hope to implement this in future games I develop, and hopefully even relatively small kids can get into the core mechanics of 
                this CA, and make very small contraption without being confused. <br>It works with colliding beams of arrows to 
                construct new beams which direction is determined by the resultant force of the beams that collided. There's a "square" and a "diamond" that works roughly the same way, 
                but on each their <abbr title="Group of 4">quartet</abbr>. An then there's the "beamer" which shoots out arrows in all 8 directions. <br>

            <h3>
                Motivation:
            </h3>
            <p>
                With inspiration from both Minecraft's redstone mechanic and the incredible projects build with it, such as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbO0tqH8f5I">working computer</a>, 
                and with inspiration from another cellular automaton <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/wi-index.html">WireWorld</a> ; I decided to set out to make my own <abbr title="Cellular Automaton">CA</abbr>.
                I had two main reasons for wanting to create my own CA. 
            </p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
                <li>I wanted to be able to implement a mechanism in future games I develop, that allows for turing complete machine builds, 
                    much like the computers in Minecraft or build with WireWorld, but without ripping off those games/people.</li>
                <li>I saw things in both Redstone and WireWorld that I personally found undesirable, were I to implement such things in future games I develop</li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                    <li>
                        WireWorld has a much desireable few-possible-states (just 4), but is very unintuitive. 
                        Although there are many tutorials out there, 
                        and I have linked to my <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/wi-index.html">favourite tutorial</a> on this page already,
                        which would alleviate the unintuitiveness,
                        I still found it rather unsatisfying that
                        <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/wires7.html">"WireWorld needed its electrons to come in spacings of at least 6, 
                            for you to be able to construct all possible GATES"</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Redstone is a bit more intuitive in my opinion, although I may be biased as I, as a minecrafter, have more experience dealing with it, than WireWorld. 
                        Redstone, however, is not designed to be very efficient as a CA, nor easily implemented in Golly. I will not be explaining all the mechanics of redstone, but I'll mention the main argument for 
                        why that is the case.
                        The redstone dust <abbr title="Think 3D cell, but Minecraft is more than just ">block</abbr> (the main "wire" of the redstone mechanics), drop off in power as it is further away from any power source (taxicab distance style). 
                        The Redstone dust block has 16 different power states and its power is determined all within one game-tick of a power source turning on or off. To allow timing of all the other redstone 
                        mechanics to stay proper, one would also need to determine a piece of redstone dust's power state, within one step in a CA program (like Golly). For that 
                        reason, one would need to scan a 15x15 neighbourhood area for each redstone dust.

                Terminology:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Just a very little section about some Terminology I want to establish before we continue.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Step:</b> I may use step as a synonym of "generation" throughout this document.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Stategroup:</b> There's a total 16 states in this CA. But there's only 4 stategroups. A stategroup is a collection of states that share the same behaviour in terms of
                    determining which state it will be in the very next step. A cell whose state is in one of these stategroups, will never turn into a state outside of the stategroup.
                    The stategroups are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>0 - 8. Vectors: These are the arrows that construct long strands of beams if they are uninterupted.</li>
                        <li>9 - 11. Square: These states represent all the states a square can be in. Either Still, Rising, or Falling.</li>
                        <li>12 - 14. Diamond: These states represent all the states a diamond can be in. Either Still, Flat, or <i>Erect</i>.</li>
                        <li>15. Beamer: Notice there's only 1 state in this stategroup. That means a beamer stays a beamer forever, and nothing else turns into one.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Vector:</b> These are the first 9 states of our automaton. Their symbols include both the blank first (index 0: "still area") state, as well as 
                    the 8 arrows. Both the still area, as well as the 8 arrows behave in the same way, when they determine what state they'll turn into 
                    next step. Therefore we must consider them the same group, and we call them vectors (the still area being mathematically equivalent to the position vector (0, 0)).
                </li>
                <li>
                     <b>Neighbours:</b> In this CA, we use Moore's Neighbourhood to determine the state that a cell will turn into. The center cell belongs to a certain stategroup, 
                    and will never be anything outside of that stategroup. The Neighbours are the last 8 cells in the neighbourhood, that determine which state within the stategroup
                    the current cell turns into.    
                </li>
